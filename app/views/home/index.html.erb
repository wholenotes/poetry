              is a multidisciplinary artist and software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
              She has lived in nine states and two continents. Art is a way for her to traverse seen and unseen geographies.<br>
              <br>Her first poetry collection is <%= link_to "ravel", "/ravel", :target => "_blank" %>,
              a finalist for the Many Voices Project by New Rivers Press, and the White Pine Press Poetry Prize.  Her work in poetry and fiction has garnered a number of Pushcart nominations.</br></br>
              Her poetry has appeared in journals such as The California Quarterly, The Columbia Review, Crab Orchard Review, The Pedestal, and Spillway.  </br></br>
              Bonnie's first play <i><h1>Liriope</h1></i> is a theatrical retelling of the Narcissus myth with movement and music.
              In an era where water conditions are extreme, and melting arctic ice has released a silencing disease into the air,
              the healer Liriope has to choose between her work containing the silencing disease and parenting her son Narcissus,
              a talented but self-absorbed performer.  Water is a character played by a dancer, and is at once parent, friend, lover, and murderer.</br></br>

              The work-in-progress staging of <i><h1>Liriope</h1></i> at Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve May 30 & 31 is a culmination of Bonnie
s artist's residency at the university.  There will be music led by Chris Chafe, and movement by Ronja Ver, Katarina Ericsson, et al.
